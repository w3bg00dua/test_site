PHP Alternative Site
====================

Phalcon PHP is a web framework delivered as a C extension providing high
performance and lower resource consumption.

This is a sample application for the Phalcon PHP Framework. We wanted to create
an alternative version of the PHP site powered by the C-extension framework.

Thanks.

Get Started
-----------

### Requirements

To run this application on your machine, you need at least:

* PHP >= 5.3.6
* Apache Web Server with mod rewrite enabled
* Latest Phalcon Framework extension enabled (0.4.x)

### Configuration

Check your database configuration and website's base URI.

    app/config/config.php

Then you'll need to create the database and initialize schema:

    php -r '
    require "app/config/config.php";

    $n = $config->database->name;
    $u = $config->database->username;
    $p = $config->database->password;

    echo `echo "CREATE DATABASE {$n}" | mysql -u {$u} -p {$p}`;
    echo `cat schemas/php_site.sql | mysql -u {$u} -p {$p} {$n}`;
    '
